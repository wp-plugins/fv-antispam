Powerful and simple antispam plugin. Puts all the spambot comments directly into trash and let's other plugins (Akismet) deal with the rest.

== Description ==
Based on Antispam Bee version 1.5.

= Why use our version? =

* More simple
* Doesn't need configuration - all the redundant and dangerous options are removed in favour of not doing mistakes in configuration
* Reliable
* No false positives
* No detectable signature for spam bots
* Blacklisted comments are put into trash
* The spam is moved directly to trash
* Works hand in hand with Akismet
* Stops only the machine spam 
* Doesn't stop human spam which Akismet will move to spam folder

> Our ratios have shown that for every 50 human spam comments a popular weblog will have up to 10 000 machine generated spam. With FV Antispam Akismet becomes a usefull tool again allowing you to browse your spam folder and pull out any Akismet false positives. If you use just Akismet, it fills your whole spam folder with all the spambot commments and you can't really browse through hundreds of spam comments every day to look for false positives.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you put the detected spam messages into trash? =

This way your spam folder is not overwhelmed with all the obvious spam messages. So you can look at this folder to check the spam messages detected by Akismet for example. And with new Wordpress versions, you can also check the trash folder, to make sure that our plugin works correctly and only deletes what's really a spam.

= Why are you putting blacklisted comments into trash? =

Same reason as above question, if a comments is already blacklisted, you don't want to think about it in spam folder.
